## Description

Fizz Buzz is a project, that is made to give an overview of diffrent languages. Or to be practical, here you see how to write a simple Fizz Buzz program in different programming languages. All of that written in clean and well documented code. Why am I doing this? 1. I think it is interersting how different languages are approaching and solving this simple Program and 2. I saw the challenge in the CodeSloth Newsletter and it kinda got out of hand. So here we are.

## How To Use

> **Note:** Since this is a collection of different programming languages, you have to have the specific language installed on your machine.\
> If you want/need help with that, feel free to ask me. Or take a look into the folder of the specific language. There you will find a README.md file with instructions on how to install the language.

It's pretty simple. Just clone the repo and run the script but to just give you the commands here they are:

```bash
# Clone the repository
$ git clone https://github.com/jotrorox/fizzbuzz.git

# Change the directory
$ cd fizzbuzz

# Run the script
$ ./fizzer.sh
```
